# What is Neural Network ?

Neural Networks as the name suggest is network of neurons. Neurons are predictors, they map an input X to an output Y. The output of one neuron is input for the next.

Neural networks have multiple layers of neurons comprising of an input, output and hidden layers in the middle. Each layer can be imagined as a stack of neurons placed on top of each other.

# Liner Regression Model of Neurons

Each neuron is in itself a liner regression model. Thus each neuron has:

1. Input vector `X`
2. Weight `W`
3. Bias `b`
4. Output `Y`

In vectorised notation it can be represented as:

```
Y = WX + b
```

The weight helps to determine the importance of the input parameter.


# Deep Learning

The process of training neural networks is known as Machine Learning, a newer term for Machine Learning is Deep Learning.

When neural neworks are implemented they are trained by giving then training data set of inputs mapping to output. Thus given `X` and `Y` neural networks are very good at determining the rest of paremeters. And also once trained neural networks are very effective in predicting the mapping of an input parameter to an output.
